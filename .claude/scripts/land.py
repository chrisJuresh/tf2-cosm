"""Land the change in the worktree this is run from: push, PR, merge, verify.

A repository can name branches it will not merge into — `protectedMergeTargets` in
`.claude/worktree-per-change.json`, empty by default. Those are pushed to and opened
against, then left for a person, because a trunk that takes reviewed PRs is one where
the PR *is* the review. See the refusal in `land()` for why that check sits at the
merge step and not in `preflight`.

This exists to be *allowlisted*, and everything about it is shaped by that.

The protocol's last three steps — push, open a PR, merge it — are the ones a
permission layer stops, because they are the ones that reach outside the machine.
Left stopped, the rule collapses into "the agent does the work and a human finishes
it", which is the failure the `Stop` hook already refuses: a branch that exists only
on this disk is not a delivered change. So the steps have to be grantable.

The obvious grant is `Bash(gh pr merge:*)`, and it is far too wide: it merges any PR
in any repository the machine is authenticated to, on any base. This script is the
narrow alternative. It takes **no PR number and no branch** — it merges the PR whose
head is the branch checked out in the worktree it was run from, into the integration
branch that repository recorded, and refuses everything else. One allowlist entry for
this file grants exactly the protocol and nothing beside it.

What it is NOT is a way around a permission decision. It runs `gh` and `git` under
their own names and prints every command before running it; a machine that has not
allowed it is a machine where it does not run. Wrapping the same commands to make them
unrecognisable would be a different program with a different purpose, and it would also
not work for long.

It stops before removing the worktree, because nothing can remove the tree it is
standing in — see SKILL.md step 4 for the two commands that follow, and the allowlist
entries that let them run.

It refuses a branch that has already merged, before pushing anything. That is not a
nicety: after a change lands there is no remote branch and no open PR, so every later
check reads like a change that was never delivered, and running this twice opens a
second PR whose diff is empty and merges it.

Where several changes are in flight against one integration branch, each one that lands
moves the base under the others, and the forge then refuses their PRs for a conflict —
after the push, from the far side of an API call, with nothing set up locally to fix it.
`mergeIntegrationBeforeLanding` in `.claude/worktree-per-change.json` (or
`--merge-integration`) brings the integration branch down into the topic branch first, so
a clean merge costs nothing and a conflicting one stops here, in a tree already set up for
the resolution. It is **off by default**: in a repo where changes land one at a time it is
a fetch and a merge commit that buy nothing.

Usage:
    python .claude/scripts/land.py              push, PR if needed, merge, verify
    python .claude/scripts/land.py --dry-run    print the sequence, run none of it
    python .claude/scripts/land.py --merge-integration   ... merge the base down first
    python .claude/scripts/land.py --title T --body-file B    ... for the PR it creates
